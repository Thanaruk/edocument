<P>The OWL Web Ontology Language is designed for use by applications =
that need=20
to process the content of information instead of just presenting =
information to=20
humans. OWL facilitates greater machine interpretability of Web content =
than=20
that supported by XML, RDF, and RDF Schema (RDF-S) by providing =
additional=20
vocabulary along with a formal semantics. OWL has three =
increasingly-expressive=20
sublanguages: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. </P>
<P>This document is written for readers who want a first impression of =
the=20
capabilities of OWL. It provides an introduction to OWL by informally =
describing=20
the features of each of the sublanguages of OWL. Some knowledge of <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#ref-rdf-sche=

After=20
this document, interested readers may turn to the <A=20

descriptions and extensive examples on the features of OWL. The =

<H2><A id=3Ds1 name=3Ds1></A>1. Introduction </H2>
<P>This document describes the OWL Web Ontology Language. OWL is =
intended to be=20
used when the information contained in documents needs to be processed =
by=20
applications, as opposed to situations where the content only needs to =
be=20
presented to humans. OWL can be used to explicitly represent the meaning =
of=20
terms in vocabularies and the relationships between those terms. This=20
representation of terms and their interrelationships is called an =
ontology. OWL=20
has more facilities for expressing meaning and semantics than XML, RDF, =
and=20
RDF-S, and thus OWL goes beyond these languages in its ability to =
represent=20
machine interpretable content on the Web. OWL is a revision of the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/#DAMLReferenc=
e">DAML+OIL=20
web ontology language</A> incorporating lessons learned from the design =
and=20
application of DAML+OIL. </P>
<H3><A id=3Ds1.1 name=3Ds1.1></A>1.1 Document Roadmap </H3>
<P>The OWL Language is described by a set of documents, each fulfilling =
a=20
different purpose, and catering to a different audience. The following =
provides=20
a brief roadmap for navigating through this set of documents: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>This <A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/">OWL =
Overview</A> gives a=20
  simple introduction to OWL by providing a language feature listing =
with very=20
  brief feature descriptions;=20
  <LI>The <A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/">OWL Guide</A> =
demonstrates=20
  the use of the OWL language by providing an extended example. It also =
provides=20
  a <A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#OWLGlossary">glossary</A> =
of the=20
  terminology used in these documents;=20
  <LI>The <A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/">OWL Reference</A> =
gives a=20
  systematic and compact (but still informally stated) description of =
all the=20
  modelling primitives of OWL;=20
  <LI>The <A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/">OWL Semantics =
and=20
  Abstract Syntax</A> document is the final and formally stated =
normative=20
  definition of the language;=20
  <LI>The <A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-test/">OWL Web Ontology =
Language=20
  Test Cases</A> document contains a large set of test cases for the =
language;=20
  <LI>The <A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/">OWL Use Cases and =

  Requirements</A> document contains a set of use cases for a web =
ontology=20
  language and compiles a set of requirements for OWL. </LI></UL>The =
suggested=20
reading order of the first four documents is as given since they have =
been=20
listed in increasing degree of technical content. The last two documents =

complete the documentation set.=20
<H3><A id=3Ds1.2 name=3Ds1.2></A>1.2 Why OWL? </H3>
<P>The Semantic Web is a vision for the future of the Web in which =
information=20
is given explicit meaning, making it easier for machines to =
automatically=20
process and integrate information available on the Web. The Semantic Web =
will=20
build on XML's ability to define customized tagging schemes and RDF's =
flexible=20
approach to representing data. The first level above RDF required for =
the=20
Semantic Web is an ontology language what can formally describe the =
meaning of=20
terminology used in Web documents. If machines are expected to perform =
useful=20
reasoning tasks on these documents, the language must go beyond the =
basic=20
semantics of RDF Schema. The <A =
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/">OWL Use=20
Cases and Requirements Document</A> provides more <A=20

<UL compact>
  <LI>
  <P><A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</A> provides a surface =
syntax for=20

meaning of=20
  these documents. </P>
  <LI>
  <P><A href=3D"http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML Schema</A> is a =

  semantics for generalization-hierarchies of such properties and =
classes. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>OWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes: =
among=20
  others, relations between classes (e.g. disjointness), cardinality =
(e.g.=20
  "exactly one"), equality, richer typing of properties, characteristics =
of=20
  properties (e.g. symmetry), and enumerated classes. </P></LI></UL>
<H3><A id=3Ds1.3 name=3Ds1.3></A>1.3 The three sublanguages of OWL </H3>

  <LI>
  <P><A id=3Dterm_OWLLite name=3Dterm_OWLLite></A><EM>OWL Lite</EM> =
supports those=20
  users primarily needing a classification hierarchy and simple =

support for=20
  OWL Lite than its more expressive relatives, and OWL Lite provides a =
quick=20
  migration path for thesauri and other taxonomies. Owl Lite also has a =

<P>Ontology developers adopting OWL should consider which sublanguage =

their needs. The choice between OWL Lite and OWL DL depends on the =
extent to=20
which users require the more-expressive constructs provided by OWL DL. =
The=20
choice between OWL DL and OWL Full mainly depends on the extent to which =
users=20
require the meta-modeling facilities of RDF Schema (e.g. defining =
classes of=20
classes, or attaching properties to classes). When using OWL Full as =
compared to=20
OWL DL, reasoning support is less predictable since complete OWL Full=20
implementations do not currently exist. </P>OWL Full can be viewed as an =

extension of RDF, while OWL Lite and OWL DL can be viewed as extensions =
of a=20
restricted view of RDF. Every OWL (Lite, DL, Full) document is an RDF =
document,=20
and every RDF document is an OWL Full document, but only some RDF =
documents will=20
be a legal OWL Lite or OWL DL document. Because of this, some care has =
to be=20
taken when a user wants to migrate an RDF document to OWL. When the=20
expressiveness of OWL DL or OWL Lite is deemed appropriate, some =
precautions=20
have to be taken to ensure that the original RDF document complies with =
the=20
additional constraints imposed by OWL DL and OWL Lite. Among others, =
every URI=20
that is used as a class name must be explicitly asserted to be of type =
owl:Class=20
(and similarly for properties), every individual must be asserted to =
belong to=20
at least one class (even if only owl:Thing), the URI's used for classes, =

properties and individuals must be mutually disjoint. The details of =
these and=20
other constraints on OWL DL and OWL Lite are explained in <A=20

<H2><A id=3Ds3 name=3Ds3></A>3. Language Description of OWL Lite </H2>
<P>This section provides an informal description of the OWL Lite =
language=20
features. We do not discuss the specific syntax of these features (see =
the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/">OWL Reference</A> for =
definitions). Each=20
language feature is hyperlinked to the appropriate place in the <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/">OWL Guide</A> for more examples =
and=20
guidance on usage. </P>
<P>OWL Lite uses only some of the OWL language features and has more =
limitations=20
on the use of the features than OWL DL or OWL Full. For example, in OWL =
Lite=20
classes can only be defined in terms of named superclasses (superclasses =
cannot=20
be arbitrary expressions), and only certain kinds of class restrictions =
can be=20
used. Equivalence between classes and subclass relationships between =
classes are=20
also only allowed between named classes, and not between arbitrary class =

expressions. Similarly, restrictions in OWL Lite use only named classes. =
OWL=20
Lite also has a limited notion of cardinality - the only cardinalities =
allowed=20
to be explicitly stated are 0 or 1. </P>

relate an=20

  property (which may be referred to as isTheSocialSecurityNumberFor) =

  most one value for any individual in the class of social security =

/A></I></B>:=20
  The restriction allValuesFrom is stated on a property with respect to =
a class.=20
  It means that this property on this particular class has a local range =

  restriction associated with it. Thus if an instance of the class is =
related by=20
  the property to a second individual, then the second individual can be =

  inferred to be an instance of the local range restriction class. For =
example,=20
  the class Person may have a property called hasDaughter restricted to =
have=20
  allValuesFrom the class Woman. This means that if an individual person =
Louise=20
  is related by the property hasDaughter to the individual Deborah, then =
from=20
  this a reasoner can deduce that Deborah is an instance of the class =
Woman.=20
  This restriction allows the property hasDaughter to be used with other =

  classes, such as the class Cat, and have an appropriate value =
restriction=20
  associated with the use of the property on that class. In this case,=20
  hasDaughter would have the local range restriction of Cat when =
associated with=20
  the class Cat and would have the local range restriction Person when=20
  associated with the class Person. Note that a reasoner can not deduce =

value for=20

  The restriction <I>someValuesFrom</I> is stated on a property with =
respect to=20
  a class. A particular class may have a restriction on a property that =
at least=20
  one value for that property is of a certain type. For example, the =
class=20
  SemanticWebPaper may have a <I>someValuesFrom</I> restriction on the=20
  hasKeyword property that states that <U>some</U> value for the =
hasKeyword=20
  property should be an instance of the class SemanticWebTopic. This =
allows for=20
  the option of having multiple keywords and as long as one or more is =
an=20
  instance of the class SemanticWebTopic, then the paper would be =
consistent=20
  with the <I>someValuesFrom</I> restriction. Unlike =
<I>allValuesFrom</I>,=20
  <I>someValuesFrom</I> does not restrict all the values of the property =
to be=20
  instances of the same class. If myPaper is an instance of the =
SemanticWebPaper=20
  class, then myPaper is related by the <I>hasKeyword</I> property to at =
least=20
  one instance of the SemanticWebTopic class. Note that a reasoner can =

<P>OWL Lite includes a limited form of cardinality restrictions. OWL =
(and OWL=20

since they=20
are stated on properties with respect to a particular class. That is, =
the=20
restrictions constrain the cardinality of that property on instances of =
that=20

arbitrary=20

  Cardinality is stated on a property with respect to a particular =
class. If a=20
  <I>minCardinality</I> of 1 is stated on a property with respect to a =
class,=20
  then any instance of that class will be related to at least one =
individual by=20
  that property. This restriction is another way of saying that the =
property is=20
  <U>required</U> to have a value for all instances of the class. For =
example,=20
  the class Person would not have any minimum cardinality restrictions =
stated on=20
  a hasOffspring property since not all persons have offspring. The =
class=20
  Parent, however would have a minimum cardinality of 1 on the =
hasOffspring=20
  property. If a reasoner knows that Louise is a Person, then nothing =
can be=20
  deduced about a minimum cardinality for her hasOffspring property. =
Once it is=20
  discovered that Louise is an instance of Parent, then a reasoner can =
deduce=20
  that Louise is related to at least one individual by the hasOffspring=20
  property. From this information alone, a reasoner can not deduce any =
maximum=20
  number of offspring for individual instances of the class parent. In =
OWL Lite=20
  the only minimum cardinalities allowed are 0 or 1. A minimum =
cardinality of=20
  zero on a property just states (in the absence of any more specific=20
  information) that the property is optional with respect to a class. =
For=20
  example, the property hasOffspring may have a minimum cardinality of =
zero on=20

can not=20

  classes have no values for a particular property. For example, =
instances of=20

</H3>OWL Lite=20

<H3><A id=3Ds3.10 name=3Ds3.10></A>3.10 OWL Lite Versioning </H3>RDF =
already has a=20
small vocabulary for describing versioning information. OWL =
significantly=20
extends this vocabulary. See the <A=20

further=20
details.=20
<H2><A id=3Ds4 name=3Ds4></A>4. Incremental Language Description of OWL =
DL and OWL=20
Full </H2>Both OWL DL and OWL Full use the same vocabulary although OWL =
DL is=20
subject to some restrictions. Roughly, OWL DL requires type separation =
(a class=20
can not also be an individual or property, a property can not also be an =

individual or class). This implies that restrictions cannot be applied =
to the=20
language elements of OWL itself (something that is allowed in OWL Full). =

Furthermore, OWL DL requires that properties are either ObjectProperties =
or=20
DatatypeProperties: DatatypeProperties are relations between instances =
of=20
classes and RDF literals and XML Schema datatypes, while =
ObjectProperties are=20
relations between instances of two classes. The <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/">OWL Semantics and Abstract =
Syntax</A>=20
document explains the distinctions and limitations. We describe the OWL =
DL and=20
OWL Full vocabulary that extends the constructions of OWL Lite below.=20

  href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#owl_oneOf">oneOf</A></I></B>:=20
  (enumerated classes): Classes can be described by enumeration of the=20
  individuals that make up the class. The members of the class are =
exactly the=20
  set of enumerated individuals; no more, no less. For example, the =
class of=20
  daysOfTheWeek can be described by simply enumerating the individuals =
Sunday,=20
  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. From this a =
reasoner=20
  can deduce the maximum cardinality (7) of any property that has =
daysOfTheWeek=20

  (property values): A property can be required to have a certain =
individual as=20
  a value (also sometimes referred to as property values). For example,=20
  instances of the class of dutchCitizens can be characterized as those =
people=20
  that have theNetherlands as a value of their nationality. (The =
nationality=20
  value, theNetherlands, is an instance of the class of Nationalities).=20

  Classes may be stated to be disjoint from each other. For example, Man =
and=20
  Woman can be stated to be disjoint classes. From this disjointWith =
statement,=20
  a reasoner can deduce an inconsistency when an individual is stated to =
be an=20
  instance of both and similarly a reasoner can deduce that if A is an =
instance=20
  of Man, then A is <I>not</I> an instance of Woman.=20

  intersectionOf</A></I></B> (Boolean combinations): OWL DL and OWL Full =
allow=20
  arbitrary Boolean combinations of classes and restrictions: unionOf,=20
  complementOf, and intersectionOf. For example, using unionOf, we can =
state=20
  that a class contains things that are either USCitizens or =
DutchCitizens.=20
  Using complementOf, we could state that children are <I>not</I>=20
  SeniorCitizens. (i.e. the class Children is a subclass of the =
complement of=20
  SeniorCitizens). Citizenship of the European Union could be described =
as the=20

Lite,=20
  cardinalities are restricted to at least, at most or exactly 1 or 0, =
full OWL=20
  allows cardinality statements for arbitrary non-negative integers. For =
example=20
  the class of DINKs ("Dual Income, No Kids") would restrict the =
cardinality of=20
  the property hasIncome to a minimum cardinality of two (while the =
property=20
  hasChild would have to be restricted to cardinality 0).=20
  <LI><B><I><A id=3DcomplexClassFull name=3DcomplexClassFull>complex=20
  classes</A></I></B> : In many constructs, OWL Lite restricts the =
syntax to=20
  single class names (e.g. in subClassOf or equivalentClass statements). =
OWL=20
  Full extends this restriction to allow arbitrarily complex class =
descriptions,=20
  consisting of enumerated classes, property restrictions, and Boolean=20
  combinations. Also, OWL Full allows classes to be used as instances =
(and OWL=20
  DL and OWL Lite do not). For more on this topic, see the "Design for =
Use"=20
